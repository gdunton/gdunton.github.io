title: The secrets of high functioning teams
---

I recently saw a video which confirmed a belief I've had for a while now. Google has done some research into what makes a team successful and they found that the most important indicator for success is average amount of time that each member speaks. If everyone on a team speaks the same amount then that team is more likely to be successful & produce better software.

If you think about what it takes to get everyone speaking the same amount then that might not be so surprising. If the team creates a safe space for everyone to voice an opinion then more people can contribute to solving problems. Have you ever worked on a team where one person dominated a meeting? Other members of those teams will start to defer decisions to those more dominating personalities.

It goes to show that so-called "soft skills" are the most important tools in an engineers' toolbox.
