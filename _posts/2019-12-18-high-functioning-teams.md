title: The secrets of high functioning teams
---

I recently saw a video which confirmed a belief I've had for a while now. Google has done some research into what makes a high functioning engineering team and it turns out that the most important indicator for the success of a team is the amount of time that each member of the team speaks. If everyone, on average, speaks the same amount then you have a healthy team and you will most likely produce better software.

If you think about what that takes then it might not be so surprising. If the team creates a safe space for everyone to voice an opinion then more people can contribute to solving problems. Have you every worked on a team where one person dominated a meeting? Other members of those teams will start to defer decisions to those more dominating personalities.

It goes to show that so-called "soft skills" are the most important tools in an engineers' toolbox.
