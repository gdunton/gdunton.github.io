This is the first post on my new site. It's taking a little longer than I'd hoped to get this new site up and running with content but other things have taken precedence. I've been trying out WebGL using Elm and trying out some new features that are hopefully coming soon. This is something that I am planning to write about but I'm not exactly sure when that will happen.

This is a little sneak peak at what that will look like
