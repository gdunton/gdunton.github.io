            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in 1990 and lived in rural England so perhaps it was inevitable that I was drawn to video games. My start was
                with our Amstrad PC and the Mega drive with games like Lemmings, Sonic the Hedgehog and as many RPGs as I
                could get hold of. It was only after I got an ancient TV to call my own and a copy of Final Fantasy VIII
                on PlayStation that I went from enjoying games to being obsessed with games.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was always fascinated by computers so after a brief exploration into digital modelling (mostly bad, I'm still a poor artist)
                I decided to try to find out how games were made and how computers ran them. Learning to program was when
                I truly realised what I wanted to do, it was like having a puzzle where there were always new things to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                I passed my A Levels in Maths, Physics and IT and got my place studying Games Technology at the University of the West of
                England. I learnt huge amounts about games while I was there and graduated with a 1st having produced some
                work that I am very proud of. I was also able to take part in some of the wider games industry around Bristol,
                attending two global games jams programming two games in two 48 hour weekends. However, it's only been since
                university that I have realised just how much there is to learn to understand what it takes to make games
                on a global commercial scale, and that it's a constant learning process.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a couple of year hiatus post university where I spent my time working (lets not talk about it), programming and playing
                world of warcraft I became a professional C++ developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now work at Titania Ltd on Nipper Studio, an award winning network auditing tool. At Titania I help write C++ systems to
                help customers find their security holes in their network devices. I also have given internal talks about
                writing better C++ code, attended ACCU 2017 and am known internally as a C++ metaprogramming enthusiast.
