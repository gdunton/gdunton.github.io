    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I'm a software developer living in Worcestershire in the UK. I went to university in Bristol at the University of the
        West of England where I studied Games Technology. I completed with a first class degree and after a couple of year
        working in another field I became a professional C++ developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently work at the Economist in Birmingham working in a polyglot team on backend services which power our website 
        and mobile apps. We use Typescript, Javascript, Bash, Golang and whatever else we need to use to get the job done. All 
        of our code runs in the AWS cloud so I'm very familiar with the core AWS services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously I worked at Titania Ltd as a senior software engineer and agile coach, where I helped write C++ systems to 
        help customers find their security holes in their network devices.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of work my interests include video games, photography and origami. I also spend time writing C++ games code,
        GBZ80 assembly and web programming in Elm.
