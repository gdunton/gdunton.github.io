  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer living in Worcestershire in the UK. I studied Games Technology at the
    University of the West of England, earning a First class degree. After a couple of year working
    in another field I became a professional software engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work as a software engineer at The Economist in Birmingham working in a Fullstack
    team owning multiple services. Use Typescript, Javascript, Bash & anything else to deliver
    greenfield backend services, front-end landing pages & improvements to our legacy applications.
    All of our code runs in the AWS cloud using a variety of different services; from EC2 all the
    way to Kubernetes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I worked at Titania Ltd as a senior software engineer and agile coach, where I helped
    write C++ systems to help customers find their security holes in their firewall, routers &
    switches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work my interests include video games, photography and origami. I also spend time
    writing ray tracers, Gameboy emulators and web programming in Elm.
