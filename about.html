    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I'm a software developer living in Worcestershire in the UK. I went to university in Bristol at the University of the
        West of England where I studied Games Technology. I completed with a first class degree and after a couple of year
        working in another field I became a professional C++ developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I now work at Titania Ltd on Nipper Studio, an award winning network auditing tool. At Titania I help write C++ systems to
        help customers find their security holes in their network devices. I also have given internal talks about writing
        better C++ code, attended ACCU 2017 and am known internally as a C++ metaprogramming enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of work my interests include video games, photography and origami. I also spend time writing C++ games code,
        GBZ80 assembly and web programming in Elm.
